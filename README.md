## Usage

### Selection commands
The top row contains commands from left–right:
- undo selection
- grow selection
- shrink selection
- continue selection

### Select by type
The rows below contain operations for several types of elements:
- smooth curves
- sharp corners
- lines
- handles
- anchors

Each type allows for three types of selection operations
- ( `+` ) add elements of type to current selection
- ( `-` ) subtract elements from current selection
- ( `○` ) select only elements of type from current selection
