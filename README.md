## Installation 
1. Clone or download this repository
1. (Unzip if necessary) and open the file with the `.glyphsTool` extension.
1. Follow the "are you sure you want to install" dialogs
1. Restart glyphs

**NOTE:** Because there are still some issues with it, this is not yet available in the Glyphs plugin manager. When things are a little more predictable and stable, you should be able to find it there.

## Usage

### Selection commands
The top row contains commands from left–right:
- undo selection
- grow selection
- shrink selection
- continue selection

### Select by type
The rows below contain operations for several types of elements:
- smooth curves
- sharp corners
- lines
- handles
- anchors
- components

Each type allows for three types of selection operations
- ( `+` ) add elements of type to current selection
- ( `-` ) subtract elements from current selection
- ( `○` ) select only elements of type from current selection
